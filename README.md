This capstone group project aims at utilizing the necessary machine learning algorithms to develop the prediction model to identify the personalized food allergens from the food image so that the asthma patient can avoid getting exposed to it. With the model developed in this paper, the asthma patients can identify their allergens by inputting the food image. The result of this study indicated that Peanut is the most allergic food for the development of asthma followed by Milk, Egg, Shellfish, and soy. Of all Tensorflow models in deep learning, ResNet50 performs better in predicting the allergens overall. Models generally perform average in predicting the Milk allergens and it can be improved by further fine tuning the model. Additional research is needed to fine tune the model. As the Sponsorâ€™s mobile application is currently focusing on environmental allergens, their application can be leveraged to include this prediction model as a separate module thereby the users can take a picture of the food and the application would output the allergens to them.
